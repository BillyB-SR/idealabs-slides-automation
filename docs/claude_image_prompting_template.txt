# Storyboard JSON Generation Instructions

## Initial Steps
1. Review any provided context slides for campaign direction and brand guidelines
2. Review any brand elements or attachments for context whenever provided or if requested.
3. Note the target aspect ratio in the JSON.
4. For storyboard slide population, disregard any images with different aspect ratios than the target.

## Image Prompt Structure
For each image_prompt, follow this format:
1. Include relevant lighting, color, atmospheric details, actions, etc.
2. No multi-scene descriptions unless explicitly split-screen
3. For split screens, specify top/bottom divisions only
4. These image prompts will be used to generate images for the storyboard.
5. If referencing the product, you have to explicitly mention the product in the prompt.

## Text Description Structure
For each corresponding text description:
1. Keep to 1-2 sentences maximum
2. Include:
   - Any on-screen text
   - Sound effects (SFX)
   - Relevant animation notes

TEXT_DESCRIPTION:
"[Short scene description]\n[On-screen text]' \n[sound effects]."

## Technical Rules
1. Never describe multiple shots in a single frame unless it's a split screen
2. For split screens, only use top/bottom divisions in vertical formats or left/right in horizontal formats
3. Maintain visual continuity between frames while ensuring each works as a standalone image
4. Consider the aspect ratio if describing spatial relationships
5. If possible, account for safe zones and text placement areas

## Pre-Submission Checklist
- Verify all image_prompts match target aspect ratio
- Confirm descriptions follow vertical thirds structure
- Check text descriptions remain within 1-2 sentences
- Ensure visual narrative flows logically
- Verify all technical specifications match JSON structure
