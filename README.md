Automated Google Slides Text and Image Replacement Using a Flexible CSV Format

Assumptions:
  - The template slide deck contains text placeholders with patterns like:
      {{C1_title}}, {{C1_text}}, {{C2_title}}, etc.
  - For image replacements, the template has image placeholders with object IDs
    that are mapped to concept IDs (e.g., "C1", "C2", ...).
  - A CSV file (e.g., concept_data.csv) contains a header row and one row per concept.
    The CSV must include a "Concept" column and can include any other columns.
    The reserved column name "image_description" (case sensitive) is used for image generation.
  - The script will create a copy of your template presentation and then update the copy.
  - The image generation function is a dummy implementation using Pillow and should be replaced
    with your own API call if needed.

Before running:
  1. Enable the Google Slides and Drive APIs in your Google Cloud project.
  2. Create a service account and download its credentials as 'credentials.json'.
  3. Share your template presentation (and upload folder, if used) with the service account.
  4. Update TEMPLATE_PRESENTATION_ID and IMAGE_OBJECT_IDS below.
